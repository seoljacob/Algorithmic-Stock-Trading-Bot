# Algorithmic-Stock-Trading-Bot
My algorithmic trading bot is designed to identify profitable trading opportunities by analyzing historical data and predicting future price movements. At the core of my bot's decision-making process is the moving average crossover, a technical analysis tool that uses the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price to identify trends and make trading decisions.

When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, it is a signal to buy. Conversely, when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, it is a signal to sell. These crossover points are used by our bot to enter and exit trades, maximizing profits while minimizing risk.

My bot is customizable, allowing users to adjust the moving averages and time frames to suit their specific trading strategies. It is also able to adapt to changing market conditions, constantly analyzing data and updating its predictions to ensure the most accurate and profitable trades.

With its advanced algorithms and customizable features, my algorithmic trading bot is a powerful tool for anyone looking to make informed and profitable trades in the fast-paced world of financial markets.

## With a starting capital of $100,000, my bot was able to grow its wealth to just over $170,000 in a span of 100 days, achieving an ROI of approximately 70%
The results are excellent. Although the bot was backtested using real stock market data, its performance is not guaranteed as it represents a specific period of time (July 29, 2022 to December 16, 2022) and thus, may have varying results with different data sets.

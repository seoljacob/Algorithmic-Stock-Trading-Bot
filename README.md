# Algorithmic-Stock-Trading-Bot
The algorithmic trading bot is designed to identify profitable trading opportunities by analyzing historical data and predicting future price movements. At the core of my bot's decision-making process is the moving average crossover, a technical analysis tool that uses the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price to identify trends and make trading decisions.
